  AGROPAN — PROJECT PROGRESS LOG
  Nepal's Smart Agriculture Platform
  Ren Hackathon Spark
================================================================================

Last Updated: 2026-02-11

================================================================================
  PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

AgroPan is a Nepal-focused smart agriculture platform combining ESP32-S3
IoT field sensors with a digital marketplace, community forum, and
emergency alert system. Connects farmers, merchants, and administrators
on a single platform. Built as a zero-dependency, client-side landing
page with plans for full-stack backend integration.

Tech Stack: HTML5 + CSS3 (Custom Properties) + Vanilla JS (ES5+)
            PHP 8.0.30 + MariaDB 10.4.32 (XAMPP) for backend API
Dependencies: Zero (frontend — no frameworks, no build tools, no npm)
CSS Architecture: variables.css (tokens) + index.css (unified stylesheet)
API Architecture: PHP CRUD folders (create/read/update/delete) + PDO

Platform Pillars:
  1. IoT Field Device — ESP32-S3 sensor node → web API
  2. Marketplace — crop prices, farmer ↔ merchant accounts
  3. Community Forum — registered farmer & merchant discussions
  4. Emergency Alerts — admin-broadcast disease/disaster warnings
