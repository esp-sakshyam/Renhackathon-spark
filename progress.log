  PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

AgroPan is a Nepal-focused IoT-enabled smart agriculture platform combining

================================================================================
  NOTES
================================================================================

  - Project is a hackathon prototype; simulation uses placeholder data
    calibrated to realistic Nepal agriculture ranges
  - All images are real Nepali agriculture photography (no stock/AI)
  - The simulation engine (simulate.js) is structured so CROP_DATA and
    DISTRICT_DATA can be replaced with real API responses in production
  - CSS architecture is token-driven: changing --color-primary updates
    the entire design system
