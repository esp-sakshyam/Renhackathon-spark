  Ren Hackathon Spark
================================================================================

Last Updated: 2026-02-11

================================================================================
  PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

AgroPan is a Nepal-focused IoT-enabled smart agriculture platform combining
ESP32-S3 field sensors, cloud monitoring, smart alerts, and predictive
simulation. Built as a zero-dependency, client-side single-page application
targeting 3.4M Nepali farming households.

Tech Stack: HTML5 + CSS3 (Custom Properties) + Vanilla JS (ES5+)
Dependencies: Zero (no frameworks, no build tools, no npm)

--- [2026-02-11] Session #1 — Project Audit & Cleanup ---

  FEATURE: Gallery Image Rename & Organization
  STATUS:  COMPLETED
  DETAILS:
    - Audited all 34 gallery images (mixed naming: UUIDs, stock IDs, 
      random strings, spaces in filenames)
    - Renamed all images to a consistent format:
        category-description.ext
      Categories: hero, iot, landscape, farm, nepal, crop, drone, logo
    - Updated all image references in index.html (14 <img> src attributes)
    - No broken links after rename
    - File: `iot` (no extension) left as-is — appears to be a
      non-image file or placeholder

  FEATURE: Progress Tracking System
  STATUS:  COMPLETED
  DETAILS:
    - Created progress.log (this file) for systematic feature tracking
    - Documents current project state, completion percentages,
      and change history

  NOTES
================================================================================

  - Project is a hackathon prototype; simulation uses placeholder data
    calibrated to realistic Nepal agriculture ranges
  - All images are real Nepali agriculture photography (no stock/AI)
  - The simulation engine (simulate.js) is structured so CROP_DATA and
    DISTRICT_DATA can be replaced with real API responses in production
  - CSS architecture is token-driven: changing --color-primary updates
    the entire design system
